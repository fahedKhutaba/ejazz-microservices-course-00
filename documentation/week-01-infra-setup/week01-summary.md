Here’s a concise and clear summary of the **first week** of your Microservices course:

### **Week 1 Summary – Introduction to Microservices with Spring Boot**

In the first week of the course, we explored the foundational concepts of **Microservice Architecture** and how it contrasts with the traditional **Monolithic Architecture**:

- **Monolithic Architecture**: A single, unified application where all components are interconnected and deployed together.
  - **Pros**: Simpler to develop and deploy initially, easier debugging.
  - **Cons**: Difficult to scale, tightly coupled components, harder to maintain and update.

- **Microservice Architecture**: An approach where the application is broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs.
  - **Pros**: Better scalability, independent deployment, improved fault isolation.
  - **Cons**: More complex infrastructure, requires robust inter-service communication and monitoring.

We then introduced the **Spring Boot framework**, highlighting its advantages in microservice development:
- Simplifies setup and configuration.
- Provides embedded servers.
- Supports rapid development with minimal boilerplate code.
- Integrates well with Spring Cloud for distributed systems.

### **Hands-On Implementation**
We began implementing our first microservice: **`account-service`**. Key components introduced:
- **Controller**: Handles incoming HTTP requests.
- **Entity**: Represents the data model.
- **Repository**: Manages data access and persistence.

We also discussed the **DTO (Data Transfer Object) design pattern**, which helps in:
- Decoupling internal data models from external representations.
- Enhancing security and performance by controlling exposed data.

The week concluded with instructions to begin defining the next microservice: **`post-service`**.

Here's a table that defines each of the listed Spring Boot dependencies along with their primary use:

| **Dependency**               | **Definition**                                                                                                                                     | **Primary Use**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spring Web**              | Provides features for building web applications, including RESTful services using Spring MVC.                                                     | To create web applications and REST APIs.                                        |
| **H2 Database**             | An in-memory, lightweight relational database written in Java.                                                                                     | For development and testing without needing an external database.               |
| **Spring Data JPA**         | Part of Spring Data, it simplifies data access using Java Persistence API (JPA) with repositories.                                                 | To interact with relational databases using JPA and reduce boilerplate code.    |
| **Spring Boot Actuator**    | Adds production-ready features like monitoring, metrics, health checks, and more.                                                                  | To monitor and manage the application in production.                            |
| **Spring Boot DevTools**    | Provides development-time features like automatic restarts, live reload, and configurations for faster development.                               | To enhance developer productivity during application development.               |
| **Lombok**                  | A Java library that reduces boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, constructors, and more at compile time using annotations.              | To simplify Java code and improve readability.                                  |
| **Spring Boot Starter Validation** | Provides support for bean validation using JSR-380 (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`) with Hibernate Validator as the default implementation.         | To validate user input and ensure data integrity in models and DTOs.            |

Title,Description,Milestone,Labels,Status
Define project structure,"As a developer, I want to define a consistent project structure, so that all services follow the same conventions and are easy to maintain.

**DoD**:
- Folder structure is defined and documented
- Shared libraries or base templates are created (if needed)
- README explains how to scaffold new services",infra-setup,epic: infra-setup,To Do
Implement config-service,"As a developer, I want to implement a centralized config-service, so that all services can load their configuration dynamically.

**DoD**:
- Config service is implemented (e.g., Spring Cloud Config)
- Configs are stored in a Git-backed repo
- At least one service successfully loads config from it
- Dockerized and runs in the network
- Documented usage and structure of config files",infra-setup,epic: infra-setup,To Do
Implement eureka-service,"As a developer, I want to set up a service registry using Eureka, so that services can discover each other dynamically.

**DoD**:
- Eureka server is implemented and running
- At least one service registers successfully
- Dockerized and networked
- Health checks enabled
- Documented registration process",infra-setup,epic: infra-setup,To Do
Implement gateway-service,"As a developer, I want to implement an API Gateway, so that all client requests are routed through a single entry point.

**DoD**:
- Gateway routes requests to at least one backend service
- Configurable via config-service
- Dockerized and part of the network
- Basic auth forwarding implemented
- Swagger or route documentation available",infra-setup,epic: infra-setup,To Do
Create shared config repo,"As a developer, I want to maintain a Git-based config repository, so that service configurations are versioned and environment-specific.

**DoD**:
- Git repo created with `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` folders
- Configs for at least one service are stored and loaded
- README explains structure and usage",infra-setup,epic: infra-setup,To Do
Set up Docker network,"As a developer, I want to set up a shared Docker network, so that all services can communicate with each other during development.

**DoD**:
- Docker Compose file includes all infra services
- Network is named and shared across services
- All services can resolve each other by name
- Verified with a test ping or health check",infra-setup,epic: infra-setup,To Do
Smoke test infra services,"As a developer, I want to perform smoke tests on the infrastructure, so that I can confirm all services are communicating correctly.

**DoD**:
- All services start successfully via Docker Compose
- Config-service loads configs
- Eureka shows registered services
- Gateway routes requests correctly
- Logs show no critical errors",infra-setup,epic: infra-setup,To Do
Document infra setup,"As a developer, I want to document the infrastructure setup, so that new team members can understand and replicate the environment.

**DoD**:
- README includes setup steps, service roles, and architecture diagram
- Config repo structure is explained
- Docker commands and troubleshooting tips included",infra-setup,epic: infra-setup,To Do

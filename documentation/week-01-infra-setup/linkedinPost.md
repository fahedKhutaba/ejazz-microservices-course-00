🚀 **Ejazz Challenge: Building the Future of Social Media in 10 Weeks** 🌐

One year ago, this was just a dream. Today, it's becoming reality.

We're now deep into the **Ejazz Challenge**—a 10-week mission to develop a scalable, microservices-based social media ecosystem. Powered by the innovative **Vibe Coding** platform, this journey is not just about writing code—it's about reshaping how we think, build, and collaborate.

From my perspective, this is more than a project. It’s the culmination of **17 years of experience** in software development, now being channeled into something truly transformative. I'm gathering every piece of knowledge I've collected over the years to bridge gaps, challenge norms, and build something that lasts.

💡 **Week 01 Highlights:**
- 🚂 The train has officially left the station!
- ✅ Successfully implemented the **Account Microservice** using **Spring Boot**
- 🔍 Explored the powerful capabilities of **Vibe Coding**
- 🤖 Witnessed how machine intelligence is now a real contributor in the development lifecycle

🔭 **Looking Ahead to Week 02:**
- 🐳 Dockerization strategy in focus
- 🛢️ Migrating databases to **PostgreSQL**
- ⚙️ Setting up configuration management
- 🌊 Riding the wave of Vibe Coding with curiosity and motivation

There’s no rigid roadmap—just a bold vision and the drive to iterate, learn, and evolve. Every week is a chance to reshape ideas, test boundaries, and push forward.

Let’s keep building. Let’s keep vibing. 💥

Here’s a concise and clear summary of the **first week** of your Microservices course:

### **Week 1 Summary – Introduction to Microservices with Spring Boot**

In the first week of the course, we explored the foundational concepts of **Microservice Architecture** and how it contrasts with the traditional **Monolithic Architecture**:

- **Monolithic Architecture**: A single, unified application where all components are interconnected and deployed together.
  - **Pros**: Simpler to develop and deploy initially, easier debugging.
  - **Cons**: Difficult to scale, tightly coupled components, harder to maintain and update.

- **Microservice Architecture**: An approach where the application is broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs.
  - **Pros**: Better scalability, independent deployment, improved fault isolation.
  - **Cons**: More complex infrastructure, requires robust inter-service communication and monitoring.

We then introduced the **Spring Boot framework**, highlighting its advantages in microservice development:
- Simplifies setup and configuration.
- Provides embedded servers.
- Supports rapid development with minimal boilerplate code.
- Integrates well with Spring Cloud for distributed systems.

### **Hands-On Implementation**
We began implementing our first microservice: **`account-service`**. Key components introduced:
- **Controller**: Handles incoming HTTP requests.
- **Entity**: Represents the data model.
- **Repository**: Manages data access and persistence.

We also discussed the **DTO (Data Transfer Object) design pattern**, which helps in:
- Decoupling internal data models from external representations.
- Enhancing security and performance by controlling exposed data.

The week concluded with instructions to begin defining the next microservice: **`post-service`**.

---

### üåê 6. **API Gateway**
- **Purpose**: Entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate services.
- **Key Features**:
  - Request routing
  - Rate limiting
  - Authentication forwarding
  - Load balancing

---

### üîç 7. **Eureka (Service Discovery)**
- **Purpose**: Keeps track of all running services and their instances.
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic service registration and discovery
  - Health checks
  - Load balancing support

---

### üìä 8. **Analytics/Feed Service** (Optional for MVP but useful)
- **Purpose**: Generates personalized feeds and tracks engagement.
- **Key Features**:
  - Feed generation based on follows/friends
  - Trending posts
  - Engagement metrics


üõ†Ô∏è Config Service Details
Purpose: Centralizes external configurations for all microservices to avoid hardcoding values.
Common Tools:
Spring Cloud Config Server (for Java/Spring Boot)
Consul or etcd (for more general use)
Key Features:
Stores configuration in Git or a centralized store
Supports dynamic refresh of configurations
Environment-specific configs (dev, staging, prod)
Secure storage of secrets (can integrate with Vault)

---

üì¨ Messaging Queue (Event Bus)
üîπ Purpose:
Facilitates asynchronous communication between services, improving decoupling, scalability, and reliability.

üîπ Common Use Cases:
Sending notifications when a post is liked or commented on
Updating follower feeds when someone posts
Logging user activity for analytics
Media processing (e.g., thumbnail generation)
üîπ Recommended Tools:
RabbitMQ ‚Äì Easy to set up, good for traditional message queuing
Apache Kafka ‚Äì High-throughput, distributed event streaming platform (ideal for analytics and real-time feeds)


üìä Analytics & Monitoring Services
üîπ Purpose:
Track system health, user behavior, and performance metrics.

üîπ Split into Two Categories:
1. System Monitoring
Tools:

Prometheus + Grafana ‚Äì For metrics collection and visualization
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) ‚Äì For centralized logging
Jaeger or Zipkin ‚Äì For distributed tracing
Monitors:

Service uptime and response times
Error rates and logs
Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
2. User Analytics
Purpose: Understand user engagement, content popularity, and growth trends.

Tools:

ClickHouse, BigQuery, or Apache Druid ‚Äì For fast analytical queries
Segment, Mixpanel, or Amplitude ‚Äì For event tracking (optional for MVP)
Tracks:

Daily active users (DAU)
Post engagement (likes, comments, reposts)
Follower growth
Media uploads


### üß∞ Additional Considerations
- **Database per service** (e.g., PostgreSQL for users, MongoDB for posts)
- **Message broker** (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) for async communication (e.g., notifications)
- **Logging and Monitoring** (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus + Grafana)

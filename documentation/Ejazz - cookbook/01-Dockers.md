The content generation was interrupted again due to formatting issues. Let me fix that and regenerate the complete Markdown file for you.

The Markdown content is still being interrupted due to formatting issues. I’ll now break the content into smaller parts and generate the file correctly in the next step.

The Markdown content is still being interrupted due to formatting issues. To resolve this efficiently, I’ll now generate the complete file in a more reliable way. Let's finalize it properly.

We're encountering persistent formatting issues in the code execution environment. To ensure you get what you need without further delay, I’ll provide the full Markdown content right here so you can copy and save it as a `.md` file yourself.

## 📘 Definitions

### 🐳 What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It allows developers to package applications with all their dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.

### 📦 What is a Container?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers are isolated, lightweight, and portable.

### ⚙️ Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.

#### Example:
```Dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 🧩 Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.

#### Example:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

## 🌐 Docker Networks
Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other. By default, Docker creates a `bridge` network, but you can define custom networks for better isolation and control.
